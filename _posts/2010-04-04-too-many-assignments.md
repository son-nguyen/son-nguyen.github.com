Title: Too many assignments
random: blog
---

Oh god, for the past couple of days, I've been trying to finish off a couple of 
assignments. Yes I admit, I bludged. Sometimes I wonder why.

Anyways, I finally added a blog page, however, it isn't quite complete yet. 
Was hoping that I could somehow ramp it up a little bit. There's also the About
Page to do... and also other assignments. TT

Short term goals:
        * Finish off Web Services Development Assignment
        * Pick up the pace with the DSA assignment.
        * Learn more about OpenGL <--- a must
        * Discover why I am doing Interface Design

Also, I'm going in a second, going to watch.. forgot what movie. I'll update
this later. I also used this time to play around with this markdown thing. 
Making a list and all. :)
